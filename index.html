        <h2>More about Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there ! <br>
            As I say before, I'm a 19-year-old graphic designer and cyber-security student from Belgium. <br>
            Like my graffiti says my name is Aloïs. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            After spending two years studying graphic design, I earned a qualification that marked a significant milestone in my creative journey.
            This program allowed me to develop a strong foundation in design principles, software tools, and visual communication.
            This qualification not only honed my skills but also ignited a deep passion for crafting compelling visual narratives
            My experience in graphic design has been invaluable, shaping my approach to creativity and problem-solving in both design and cybersecurity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My interest in cybersecurity began unexpectedly through YouTube.
            I was fascinated by videos showcasing the world of hacking and digital defense, which ignited a passion for the field. 
            To pursue this interest further, I enrolled in a university cybersecurity program. 
            However, I soon realized that the program’s broad curriculum didn’t align with my specific interests in red teaming and blue teaming.
            Seeking deeper specialization, I decided to pause my formal studies to focus on hands-on experiences and targeted learning in these areas.
            My enthusiasm for cybersecurity remains strong as I continue to explore and develop my skills in the areas I’m most passionate about.
